/* Rough rules:
 
 Story will be spoken from one person.UI reflects the speaker.
 Cutscenes will be written like a book、this person says、this person said、etc.
 Your character "points out" and does not speak in quotations (until the very end).
 Everything is kept gender neutral except for the Princess and Emperor.
 ?? maybe change this to work out who is speaking based on previous context.
 Keep descriptions short.
 Try not to tell the reader how they feel about things、only convey pain or sensations (or the lack of them).
 Keep everything in the present tense.
 Changing to a new cutscene can be used to show passing of time or a sharp cut.
 If passing time、use a fade transition.
